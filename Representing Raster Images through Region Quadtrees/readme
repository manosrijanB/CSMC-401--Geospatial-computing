The assignment consists of the design and
implementation of:
• a data structure for the region quadtree;
• an algorithm for building the region quadtree from a binary matrix representing the input image;
• an algorithm to output the structure and the content of the region quadtree;
• an algorithm for computing the intersection of two region quadtrees;
• an algorithm for computing the image clipped by a rectangle window.

run the program, you will asked to enter the names of the files, enter them correctly. 
image1 and image2 are the input files which are already given.
test1 and test2 are the different input files usesd for testing.
