To run the program successfully, the first step is to ensure that the directory is set to "provided_code_project". Next, open the terminal and type in the following commands for the respective tasks:

For task 1: "python3 main_test_demo.py ./data_part_II/test_bathymetric.pts 100"

For task 2: "python3 main_test_demo.py ./data_part_II/test_chm.pts 100"

Executing these commands will generate the output images for the bathymetric data set with a capacity of 100. It is important to provide the correct file path for the test data set and specify the desired capacity for the images. By following these steps, the program will be executed successfully.
